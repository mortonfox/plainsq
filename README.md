# PlainSquare - Foursquare v2 client for mobile browsers

PlainSquare is a lightweight Foursquare client for both mobile and desktop web browsers. It is intended as a full-featured substitute for Foursquare Mobile. PlainSquare supports both geolocation (using device GPS or cellular / wi-fi positioning) and manual coordinate entry for phones without GPS.

PlainSquare speeds up a check-in by making this operation single-click if you do not need to shout or change your broadcast options. PlainSquare is designed to send you through as few screens as possible to do most common Foursquare tasks.

PlainSquare uses OAuth version 2 to log in to Foursquare to avoid having to store user passwords. PlainSquare supports version 2 of the Foursquare API. It is written in Python and designed for hosting on Google App Engine.
